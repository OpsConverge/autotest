# Local Backend Setup

This app now uses a local Node/Express backend for authentication (email/password) and API data.

## To run the backend:
1. Go to the `backend/` directory (to be created).
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start` (or `node index.js`).

The frontend expects the backend at `http://localhost:4000/api`.

## Authentication
- Register a new user with email/password.
- Login with those credentials.

(See backend/README.md for more details after backend is scaffolded.)
